# GFlowPlanner: Efficient Training of LLM Policy for Diverse Reasoning

We focus on generating diverse solution trajectories in multi-step reasoning problems. Specifically, we formulate LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow from an initial state to terminals and adapt the GFlowNets training approach to enable diverse reasoning and apply our method on embodied reasoning (BlocksWorld), puzzle solving (Game of 24), and logical reasoning (PrOntoQA) tasks.
