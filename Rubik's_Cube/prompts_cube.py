arc_instruct = '''You are provided with a series of input-output pairs, where each value from 'a' to 'j' represents a different color, and '.' denotes a blank cell. For example, [['.','a','.'],['.','.','b']] represents a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns, where color 'a' is at position (1,0) and color 'b' is at position (2,1). 

Coordinates are expressed in 2D positions (row, col), with 'row' indicating the row number and 'col' indicating the column number, both using zero-based indexing. The input-output pairs may not cover all possibilities, so you should infer the simplest possible relationship between them.

Your task is to reason through a sequence of Python functions that can transform the input grid into the output grid. Please strictly follow this process to form the appropriate Python function.

[STATEMENT]
You have the following input-output pairs:
[Initial Grid State]:
<init_state>

Based on the provided list of Python functions, select the appropriate function to achieve the transformation from the input to the output:

<python_function>

Now, please choose one function from the above list:
